## Playing

The game is currently avaliable at [jsiso](https://github.com/wardi/urwid) however, it is currently under development so don't expect much currently.

## Contributing

At this point in time, I will not accept pull requests as this project is very young. As I release a stable, working version I will accept new features/bug fixes.
