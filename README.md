# delta-cubed

## NOTICE: This project is abandoned, I will no longer work on it for the time being. Don't expect any development.

## Summary

*Delta-cubed* is a HTML5 and JS game that will combine elements of a turn-based strategy battle system with a RPG.

*Delta-cubed* uses the [jsiso](https://github.com/beakable/isometric) library, however, more libraries are used.

The three main characters will be shapes (triangle/tetrahedron, circle/sphere, square/cube).

## Playing

The game is currently avaliable at [http://argarak.github.io/delta-cubed](http://argarak.github.io/delta-cubed) however, it is currently under development so don't expect much currently.

## Contributing

At this point in time, I will not accept pull requests as this project is very young. As I release a stable, working version I will accept new features/bug fixes.
